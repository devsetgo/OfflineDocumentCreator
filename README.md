# OfflineDocumentCreator
Creating a way to make offline documentation from a few of my favorite libraries.

### Libraries setup to Download
The libraries listed - FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Loguru, HTTPX, TQDM, Pydantic, Textblob, Pytest, and Passlib - are the ones that will be downloaded. Each library's documentation will be fetched from its respective website, converted into a PDF, and then all these PDFs will be combined into a single document. This consolidated PDF will provide a comprehensive reference for all these libraries, making it easier to access and navigate through their documentation.
